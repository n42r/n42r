Hi. 

I recently completed my PhD and I am still in that exciting in between phase exploring where I want to go in the next step. In my free time, I am currently active at the [Protecta Studio](https://github.com/protecta-studio) organization, an R&D/design studio crossover for software. Currently, we are working on publishing our first product, the *Offering Management Framework (OMF)*, in an open-standards track. The OMF is loosely based on the work I did in my PhD.
