Hi. 

I recently completed my PhD and I am still in that exciting in between phase exploring where I want to go in the next step. On github, I am currently active at [Protecta Studio](https://github.com/protecta-studio) organization, where we are working on publishing my doctoral work on a open-standards liscense.
